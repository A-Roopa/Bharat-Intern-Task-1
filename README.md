OVERVIEW OF PROJECT 
Project: SMS Classifier on SMS DataSet

Objective:

The objective is to develop an SMS classifier that accurately distinguishes between spam and non-spam messages. This is achieved by preprocessing text data, extracting features, and training various machine learning models. The goal is to identify the best-performing model for real-time spam detection. This ensures users receive only relevant and safe messages.

Key Activities:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize text data using techniques like lowercase conversion, stop word removal, and lemmatization or stemming.
Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical features using the TF-IDF vectorizer to create meaningful representations for the machine learning models.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) using grid search for hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate their performance with classification reports and confusion matrices.
Prediction: Implement a function to classify new messages as spam or non-spam using the best-performing model from the evaluations.

Technology:

Programming Language: Python, chosen for its rich libraries and tools for data science and machine learning.
Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, NLTK for text preprocessing, scikit-learn for machine learning, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
Algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, selected for their effectiveness in text classification tasks.
Tools: TF-IDF Vectorizer for feature extraction, GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, and Pipelines to streamline preprocessing and model training.
